# Synopsis

It is paramount to the public health and economy to optimise the use of resources in order to prevent and/or mitigate the effects of severe weather events. In order to help prioritise resource use, this report examines the [US National Weather Service Storm Database](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf) to determine the types of events most harmful to population health and the ones that have the greatest economic consequences. Our data analysis indicates that X events are most harmful to population health and Y events have the greatest economic consequences.
